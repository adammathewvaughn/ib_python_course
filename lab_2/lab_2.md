# Lab 2: File I/O

Deadline: Sunday May 15th, 11:59 PM

Overview

    From last week's lecture we talked about File I/O and while loops; however, we are just going to focus on File I/O since we can focus on while loops in the next big assignment. You may notice that I am not providing a .py for you this time because you are going to make everything on your own! Please read the requirements carefully:
Every code block should be in a function
You can do this with just 2 functions, but I highly recommend using helper functions to divvy up the work and make the code more readable
Doc strings are required for all functions

Module 1: Read and write data
In the file random.txt, read the numbers line by line and write them to a new file called new_random.txt. Every number should be on a separate new line. You must use iteration for this
Module 2: Read, manipulate, and write data
In the file names.txt, read the names line by line, reverse each name (string), and write the newly reversed strings to the file new_names.txt. Every name (string) should be on a separate new line. You must use iteration for this

Deliverables:
Your .py file with the specifications above
